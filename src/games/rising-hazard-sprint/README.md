# Rising Hazard Sprint (template game)

2-minute escalating-hazard survival sprint.

## Goals (MVP)
- Round loop: LOBBY → COUNTDOWN → RUNNING (~90s) → RESULTS
- Data-driven hazard timeline (v1: rising kill-height)
- Panic-ramp pacing (fast start, quick retries)
- Elimination tracking + simple HUD

## Notes
- Mechanics-only; no Roblox IP/branding/assets.
- This is intentionally minimal: a vertical slice you can iterate into more hazards, weekly quests, cosmetics.
